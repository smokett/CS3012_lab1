Added a isInTheTree function to determine if a value is in the tree. This function is called in the top of the searchLCA function,
so the searchLCA function will only run when both values are in the tree.

Added Junit test for the function isInTheTree and also added Junit test for non existing values for searchLCA function

Added Node Class
Wrote a static solution for the LCA called searchLCA
Wrote simple tests for the solution, here's a error with non existing node in the tree, need to be fixed next time.
